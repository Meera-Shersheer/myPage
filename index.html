    <h2 class="space">Who we are</h2>
    <p class="space">
        This question seems to be easy to answer but if we give it a thought we will see how hard this
        question is. What we really like or hate and what is making us feeling that way about it
        , what we are passionate about, what is the thing that makr us wake up in the morning , are we just a way so
        someone can make his unfulfilled dream become true or are we the the group of situations that we go through,
        are we all of that or none

    </p>

    <p class="space">The answer is not that simple but for myself I'll try to see who truly I'm and you can do that too
        , click the picture so you can see my journey in discovering myself and also you can have
        some inspiration form that so give it a try .

    <!-- a:anchor -->
    <p class="space">If someone asked you what's art what would you answer? alot of people will say it is playing an instrument or 
        painting or making a statue while art is in everything from how to eat to how to talk to people , art is doing what you love 
        without thinking about others , art isdoing something that make you lose the track of time , art is evrywhere and anywhere 
        from the fallen leaves and the bird's singing to the great pieces of Beethoven and the paintings of van goph and davinci
